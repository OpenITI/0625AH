90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The second volume which appears after the indexes is kind of
    research notes of the editor. So, I tagged it as editorial. 2- Sometimes there
    are a few asterisks under a title and after that the author starts talking about
    a different subject. To present the most accurate categorization of the
    subjects, these parts need additional titles in square brackets; however,
    someone must read the whole text very carefully to be able to add such titles.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
